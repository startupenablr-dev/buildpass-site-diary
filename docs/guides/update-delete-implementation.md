# Site Diary - Update and Delete Implementation

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Scope**: Complete CRUD functionality for Site Diary application  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and Ready for Testing

---

## 📋 Overview

I've successfully implemented the **Update** and **Delete** functionality for the Site Diary application, completing the full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The implementation follows all the coding patterns and best practices outlined in the project documentation.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Backend GraphQL Mutations** ✅

**File**: `apps/web/src/app/api/graphql/mutation.ts`

Added two new GraphQL mutations:

#### `updateSiteDiary`

- Updates an existing diary entry by ID
- Accepts the same input structure as create
- Returns the updated diary or `null` if not found
- Maintains data integrity by updating the in-memory store

#### `deleteSiteDiary`

- Deletes a diary entry by ID
- Returns `boolean` (true if deleted, false if not found)
- Properly removes entry from in-memory store

**Implementation Details**:

```typescript
/** @gqlMutationField */
export function updateSiteDiary(
  id: string,
  input: SiteDiaryInput,
): SiteDiary | null {
  const index = siteDiaries.findIndex((diary) => diary.id === id);

  if (index === -1) {
    return null;
  }

  const updatedDiary: SiteDiary = {
    id, // Keep the same ID
    date: input.date,
    createdBy: input.createdBy,
    title: input.title,
    content: input.content,
    weather: input.weather as Weather | undefined,
    attendees: input.attendees,
    attachments: input.attachments,
  };

  siteDiaries[index] = updatedDiary;
  return updatedDiary;
}

/** @gqlMutationField */
export function deleteSiteDiary(id: string): boolean {
  const index = siteDiaries.findIndex((diary) => diary.id === id);

  if (index === -1) {
    return false;
  }

  siteDiaries.splice(index, 1);
  return true;
}
```

---

### 2. **Frontend GraphQL Queries** ✅

**File**: `apps/web/src/graphql/queries.ts`

Added GraphQL query definitions for the frontend:

```graphql
mutation UpdateSiteDiary($id: String!, $input: SiteDiaryInput!) {
  updateSiteDiary(id: $id, input: $input) {
    id
    title
    date
    createdBy
    content
    weather {
      temperature
      description
    }
    attendees
    attachments
  }
}

mutation DeleteSiteDiary($id: String!) {
  deleteSiteDiary(id: $id)
}
```

---

### 3. **Edit Form Component** ✅

**File**: `apps/web/src/components/site-diary/diary-edit-form.tsx`

Created a complete edit form component with:

- Pre-populated form fields with existing diary data
- Form validation (matching create form)
- Weather selector integration
- Attendee management (comma-separated input)
- Image URL management
- Loading states and error handling
- Navigation after successful update

**Key Features**:

- Uses `useSuspenseQuery` to fetch existing diary data
- Pre-fills all form fields with current values
- Handles optional fields (content, weather, attendees, attachments)
- Provides user feedback during submission
- Refetches data after update to keep UI in sync

---

### 4. **Edit Page** ✅

**File**: `apps/web/src/app/diary/[id]/edit/page.tsx`

Created the edit page route at `/diary/[id]/edit`:

- Server component that handles routing
- Preloads diary data using Apollo's `PreloadQuery`
- Provides loading and error states
- Includes cancel button back to detail view

---

### 5. **Enhanced Detail View** ✅

**File**: `apps/web/src/components/site-diary/diary-detail.tsx`

Enhanced the existing detail view with:

#### Edit Button

- Opens edit page for the current diary entry
- Uses Lucide React `Edit2` icon
- Positioned prominently at the top

#### Delete Button

- Triggers confirmation dialog before deletion
- Uses Lucide React `Trash2` icon
- Styled as destructive/danger button
- Shows loading state during deletion

#### Delete Confirmation Dialog

- Built with Radix UI AlertDialog component
- Clear warning message
- Shows diary title in confirmation prompt
- Cancel and Delete action buttons
- Prevents accidental deletions

**User Experience Flow**:

1. User views diary detail
2. Clicks "Edit" → navigates to edit page
3. Clicks "Delete" → sees confirmation dialog
4. Confirms deletion → diary deleted, redirected to list page

---

### 6. **Alert Dialog UI Component** ✅

**File**: `apps/web/src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx`

Created a new Radix UI-based alert dialog component following shadcn/ui patterns:

- Accessible and keyboard-navigable
- Smooth animations
- Follows existing design system
- Reusable across the application

**Dependency Added**: `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog@1.1.15`

## 🎨 Design Patterns Followed

### 1. **Consistency with Existing Code**

- Edit form mirrors the create form structure
- Same validation logic and error handling
- Matching UI/UX patterns and styling
- Reuses existing components (DatePicker, WeatherSelector, ImageUploader)

### 2. **Type Safety**

- All components fully typed with TypeScript
- Uses generated GraphQL types
- No `any` types used

### 3. **Error Handling**

- GraphQL mutations handle errors gracefully
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states during async operations
- Network error recovery

### 4. **User Experience**

- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Clear action buttons with appropriate icons
- Loading indicators during operations
- Automatic navigation after successful actions
- Cancel buttons to abort operations

### 5. **Apollo Client Best Practices**

- Uses `useSuspenseQuery` for data fetching
- Implements `refetchQueries` to keep cache fresh
- Proper mutation callbacks (`onCompleted`, `onError`)
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate

## 🧪 How to Test

### Testing Update Functionality:

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   yarn dev:web
   ```

2. **Navigate to diary list**: http://localhost:3000/diary

3. **Click on any diary entry** to view details

4. **Click "Edit" button** at the top of the detail view

5. **Modify any fields**:
   - Change the title
   - Update date
   - Edit description
   - Add/remove attendees
   - Update weather information
   - Add/remove image URLs

6. **Click "Update Diary Entry"**

7. **Verify**:
   - You're redirected back to the detail view
   - All changes are reflected
   - Data persists when navigating away and back

### Testing Delete Functionality:

1. **View any diary entry detail page**

2. **Click "Delete" button** (red button at top)

3. **Confirmation dialog appears** with:
   - "Are you sure?" title
   - Warning message with diary title
   - Cancel and Delete buttons

4. **Click "Cancel"** to abort (dialog closes, diary remains)

5. **Or click "Delete"** to confirm:
   - Dialog closes
   - Diary is deleted
   - Redirected to diary list page
   - Deleted entry no longer appears in list

### Testing Edge Cases:

1. **Try editing with invalid data**:
   - Clear required fields (title, date, creator)
   - Should show validation errors
   - Should prevent submission

2. **Test cancel buttons**:
   - Click "Cancel" in edit form
   - Should navigate back without saving changes

3. **Test with empty optional fields**:
   - Edit a diary with weather and remove it
   - Edit attendees and clear them
   - Should save successfully with undefined values

## 📝 Technical Notes

### GraphQL Schema Changes

The generated GraphQL schema now includes:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createSiteDiary(input: SiteDiaryInput!): SiteDiary!
  updateSiteDiary(id: String!, input: SiteDiaryInput!): SiteDiary
  deleteSiteDiary(id: String!): Boolean!
}
```

### Type Safety

All mutations are fully typed:

- Input types generated from Grats annotations
- Return types match GraphQL schema
- Frontend uses generated TypeScript types
- No runtime type errors

### Error Handling

- GraphQL errors are caught and displayed
- Network failures are handled gracefully
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **In-Memory Storage**: Data is lost on server restart (as designed)
2. **No Soft Delete**: Deletions are permanent (no undo/restore)
3. **No Audit Trail**: No tracking of who edited/deleted entries
4. **No Concurrent Edit Protection**: Last write wins if multiple users edit simultaneously
5. **No Image Upload**: Still uses URL inputs (not actual file uploads)

These are inherent to the current architecture and would be addressed with database integration and enhanced features in a production deployment.
