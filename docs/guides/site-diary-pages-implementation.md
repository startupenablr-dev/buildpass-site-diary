# Site Diary Complete System - Implementation Guide

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Implemented Features:** List Page, Detail Page, and Create Page with full CRUD functionality

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Minimal Changes Philosophy

**When making changes to this codebase:**

- ✅ **Only modify what's necessary** to implement the requested feature
- ✅ **Preserve existing code** - don't refactor or "improve" code that works
- ✅ **Keep original styling** - don't change layouts, footers, or UI that wasn't requested
- ✅ **Add, don't replace** - add new functionality alongside existing code
- ❌ **Don't make aesthetic changes** - if it wasn't broken, don't fix it
- ❌ **Don't modify unrelated files** - stay focused on the feature scope

**Example from this implementation:**

- ❌ **Bad:** Completely rewrote `page.tsx` with new layout and footer
- ✅ **Good:** Only added a single navigation button to existing `page.tsx`

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Backend Fixes & Enhancements**

Fixed critical data persistence bugs:

- **File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/graphql/mutation.ts`
  - Fixed `createSiteDiary` mutation to actually save data to the array
  - Added nanoid for automatic ID generation
  - Enhanced `SiteDiaryInput` to include all optional fields (content, weather, attendees, attachments)
  - Added `WeatherInput` type for nested weather object
- **File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/site-diary/route.ts`
  - Fixed REST POST endpoint to persist data

### 2. **Enhanced GraphQL Queries & Mutations**

Updated queries and added mutations:

- **File:** `apps/web/src/graphql/queries.ts`
- Added `SITE_DIARIES` query with full field selection (date, createdBy, content, weather, attendees, attachments)
- Added `SITE_DIARY` query for single entry retrieval
- Added `CREATE_SITE_DIARY` mutation for creating new entries

### 3. **Form Components**

Created reusable form components with shadcn/ui:

  - Calendar widget with popover
  - Formats dates to YYYY-MM-DD
  - Uses date-fns for date formatting
  - Accessible with keyboard navigation

- **Weather Selector** (`apps/web/src/components/site-diary/weather-selector.tsx`)
  - Temperature input (numeric)
  - Weather condition dropdown with icons (sunny, cloudy, rainy, stormy, windy, snowy, foggy)
  - Uses lucide-react icons for visual feedback

- **Image Uploader** (`apps/web/src/components/site-diary/image-uploader.tsx`)

  - GraphQL mutation integration
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Comma-separated attendees input
  - Automatic redirect to list page on success

### 4. **Site Diary List Component**

Created a responsive card-based list component:

- **File:** `apps/web/src/components/site-diary/diary-list.tsx`
- Displays all diary entries in a responsive grid (1-3 columns based on screen size)
- Shows key information: title, date, creator, weather badge, content preview
- Includes counts for attendees and photos
- Click to navigate to detail view
- Added "Create New Entry" button for easy access

### 5. **Site Diary Detail Component**

Created a comprehensive detail view:

- Displays complete entry information
- Weather badge with temperature and description
- Full attendee list with styled badges
- Photo gallery with responsive grid layout
- Hover effects on images

### 6. **UI Components**

Added shadcn/ui components:

- **Card components:** `apps/web/src/components/ui/card.tsx`
- **Badge component:** `apps/web/src/components/ui/badge.tsx`
- **Input component:** `apps/web/src/components/ui/input.tsx`
- **Textarea component:** `apps/web/src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`
- **Label component:** `apps/web/src/components/ui/label.tsx`
- **Select component:** `apps/web/src/components/ui/select.tsx`
- **Calendar component:** `apps/web/src/components/ui/calendar.tsx`
- **Popover component:** `apps/web/src/components/ui/popover.tsx`

### 7. **Page Routes**

Created Next.js App Router pages:

- **List Page:** `apps/web/src/app/diary/page.tsx` - Shows all diary entries with Create button
- **Detail Page:** `apps/web/src/app/diary/[id]/page.tsx` - Shows single entry
- **Create Page:** `apps/web/src/app/diary/create/page.tsx` - Form to create new entries (NEW)
- **Updated Home:** `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` - Added navigation to diary list

- ✅ New entry shows with only required data

##### Test Case D: Weather Validation

**Actions:**

1. Enter temperature but don't select weather condition
2. Or: Select weather condition but don't enter temperature
3. Click "Create Diary Entry"

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Entry created successfully
- ✅ Weather object is NOT created (requires both temperature AND condition)

##### Test Case E: Cancel Action

**Actions:**

1. Start filling form
2. Click "Cancel" button

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Navigates back to `/diary` without saving
- ✅ No new entry created

---

#### 4. Test Image Uploader

**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/diary/create`

**Valid Image URLs to Test:**

```
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517089596392-fb9a9033e05b?w=800
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541888946425-d81bb19240f5?w=800
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504307651254-35680f356dfd?w=800
```

**Actions:**

1. Paste valid URL in Photos input
2. Click "Add Image"
3. Observe preview appears
4. Hover over image
5. Click X button to remove
6. Try adding invalid URL like `not-a-url`

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Valid URLs show preview immediately
- ✅ Images display in grid (2 cols mobile, 3 cols desktop)
- ✅ Remove button (X) appears on hover
- ✅ Invalid URLs show error: "Please enter a valid image URL"
- ✅ Can add multiple images one at a time

---

#### 5. Test Backend Persistence

**Actions:**

1. Create a new diary entry
2. Navigate back to list page
3. Refresh browser (F5 or Cmd+R)
4. Check if new entry is still visible

**Expected Results:**

- ⚠️ Entry visible BEFORE refresh (in-memory storage works)
- ⚠️ Entry DISAPPEARS after refresh (known limitation: no database)
- ✅ Seed data (5 original entries) always present

**Note:** This is expected behavior. The app uses in-memory storage that resets on server restart. For persistent storage, a database would be needed (see Future Enhancements).

---

### GraphQL Testing (Optional)

If you want to test the GraphQL mutation directly:

**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/graphql`

**Mutation:**

```graphql
mutation CreateDiary {
  createSiteDiary(
    input: {
      title: "GraphQL Test Entry"
      date: "2025-10-25"
      createdBy: "GraphQL Tester"
      content: "Testing direct GraphQL mutation"
      weather: { temperature: 20, description: "sunny" }
      attendees: ["Alice", "Bob"]
      attachments: [
        "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541888946425-d81bb19240f5?w=800"
      ]
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    date
    createdBy
    content
    weather {
      temperature
      description
    }
    attendees
    attachments
  }
}
```

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Returns newly created diary with auto-generated ID
- ✅ Entry appears in list page at `/diary
  - Each card shows title, date, creator, weather
  - Hover over cards for shadow effect
  - Click any card to view details
  ```

  ```

3. **Detail Page:**

   ```
   Navigate to http://localhost:3000/diary/cm4lvx1rf00006fujdr7w5u9h
   - Should see full diary entry
   - Weather badge displayed
   - Attendees listed with badges
   - Photos displayed in grid
   - Click "Back to List" to return
   ```

4. **Responsive Testing:**
   ```
   Resize browser window
   - Mobile: 1 column layout
   - Tablet: 2 columns
   - Desktop: 3 columns
   ```
