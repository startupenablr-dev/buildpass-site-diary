# PreloadQuery + Dynamic Rendering - Technical Explanation

**Question:** Does `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` break PreloadQuery?  
**Answer:** ❌ **NO** - They work perfectly together!

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**PreloadQuery** = Server-side data fetching  
**`force-dynamic`** = When to render (request time vs build time)

These are **complementary**, not contradictory!

---

## 📚 Detailed Explanation

### What `PreloadQuery` Does

`PreloadQuery` is part of Apollo Client's Next.js integration. It:

1. **Runs on the server** (during page render)
2. Fetches data from your GraphQL API
3. Pre-populates the Apollo cache
4. Passes the hydrated cache to client components

**Code Example:**

```tsx
// Server Component
<PreloadQuery query={SITE_DIARIES}>
  <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
    <DiaryStats /> {/* Client component reads from cache */}
  </Suspense>
</PreloadQuery>
```

### What `force-dynamic` Does

`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` tells Next.js:

- ❌ **DON'T** render this page at **build time** (Static Generation)
- ✅ **DO** render this page at **request time** (Server-Side Rendering)

**It does NOT:**

- ❌ Disable server-side rendering
- ❌ Force client-side only rendering
- ❌ Affect how data is fetched

---

## 🔄 Rendering Strategies Comparison

### Option 1: Static Generation (SSG) - DEFAULT

```tsx
// No dynamic export
const Page = () => {
  return <PreloadQuery query={SITE_DIARIES}>...</PreloadQuery>;
};
```

**Timeline:**

```
yarn build
  ↓
Next.js generates static HTML
  ↓
PreloadQuery tries to fetch data
  ↓
❌ GraphQL server not running
  ↓
❌ Build fails
```

**Use When:**

- Data rarely changes
- Build-time server available
- Want fastest possible loads

### Option 2: Dynamic Rendering (SSR) - OUR CHOICE ✅

```tsx
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'; // ← Added this
const Page = () => {
  return <PreloadQuery query={SITE_DIARIES}>...</PreloadQuery>;
};
```

**Timeline:**

```
User requests page
  ↓
Next.js server renders on-demand
  ↓
PreloadQuery fetches from http://localhost:3000/api/graphql
  ↓
✅ GraphQL server IS running (same process!)
  ↓
✅ Data fetched successfully
  ↓
✅ HTML sent to browser with data
```

**Use When:**

- Data changes frequently (✅ our case!)
- Real-time data important
- Can't pre-render at build time

### Option 3: Client-Side Only (CSR)

```tsx
'use client';
const Page = () => {
  const { data } = useQuery(SITE_DIARIES); // No PreloadQuery
  return <div>{data}</div>;
};
```

**Timeline:**

```
Browser loads empty page
  ↓
JavaScript executes
  ↓
Fetches data from API
  ↓
Renders with data
```

**Use When:**

- Interactive dashboards
- User-specific data
- Authentication required

## 🎭 The Complete Flow with Dynamic Rendering

### Server-Side (Our Implementation)

```
1. User Request
   ↓
2. Next.js Server (Port 3000)
   ↓
3. Renders page.tsx (Server Component)
   ↓
4. Executes PreloadQuery
   ↓
5. Makes internal HTTP request to /api/graphql
   ↓
6. GraphQL resolver runs
   ↓
7. Returns site diary data
   ↓
8. PreloadQuery populates Apollo cache
   ↓
9. Renders client component with cached data
   ↓
10. Sends complete HTML to browser
    ↓
11. Browser displays immediately (no loading!)
    ↓
12. React hydrates (interactive)
```

### What the User Sees

✅ **Fast initial render** - HTML includes data  
✅ **No loading spinners** - Data pre-fetched  
✅ **Instant interactivity** - React hydrates  
✅ **Always fresh data** - Fetched on every request

---

## 🔍 Code Evidence

### Page Component (Server)

```tsx
// apps/web/src/app/diary/page.tsx

// This tells Next.js: "Render at REQUEST time, not BUILD time"
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

const DiaryListPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <PageContainer maxWidth="7xl">
      <PageHeader title="Site Diaries" />

      {/* PreloadQuery runs on SERVER during page render */}
      <PreloadQuery query={SITE_DIARIES}>
        <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
          {/* Client component, gets pre-loaded data */}
          <DiaryList />
        </Suspense>
      </PreloadQuery>
    </PageContainer>
  );
};
```

### Client Component (Reads Cache)

```tsx
// apps/web/src/components/site-diary/diary-list.tsx

'use client'; // ← This is a CLIENT component

export const DiaryList: React.FC = () => {
  // useSuspenseQuery reads from cache populated by PreloadQuery
  // NO additional network request needed!
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery<SiteDiariesQuery>(SITE_DIARIES);

  return (
    <div>
      {data.siteDiaries.map((diary) => (
        <DiaryCard key={diary.id} diary={diary} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## ✅ Benefits of Our Approach

### 1. **Data Freshness**

Every request gets the latest data - perfect for construction diaries that update frequently.

### 2. **Fast Initial Load**

HTML includes data, so no loading spinners or blank states.

### 3. **SEO Friendly**

Search engines can index the full content (not that it matters for internal app, but good practice).

### 4. **Simple Architecture**

No complex caching strategies needed - fresh data on every request.

### 5. **Development Ease**

Consistent behavior in dev and prod - what you see is what you get.

## 🆚 Alternative: Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

**If you had a database**, you could use ISR:

```tsx
export const revalidate = 60; // Rebuild every 60 seconds

const Page = () => {
  return <PreloadQuery query={SITE_DIARIES}>...</PreloadQuery>;
};
```

**Pros:**

- Static speed + dynamic freshness
- Lower server load

**Cons:**

- More complex
- Requires database
- Data can be stale for up to 60s

**Why we didn't choose it:**

- In-memory data store (not persistent)
- Small app (server load not a concern)
- Simplicity preferred

## 🎓 Interview Talking Points

When discussing this decision, emphasize:

### 1. **Problem Identification**

"I encountered a build failure because pages were trying to pre-render with data fetching."

### 2. **Analysis**

"I analyzed the Next.js rendering strategies and determined that dynamic rendering (SSR) was most appropriate for this use case."

### 3. **Rationale**

"For an application with frequently changing data, server-side rendering ensures users always see fresh content without complex caching logic."

### 4. **Trade-offs**

"The trade-off is slightly higher server load compared to static generation, but for a construction diary app with moderate traffic, the benefits of data freshness outweigh this concern."

### 5. **Future Optimization**

"With a proper database layer, I would explore Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to combine the speed of static generation with the freshness of dynamic rendering."

## 🔧 Common Misconceptions

### ❌ Myth 1: "force-dynamic disables PreloadQuery"

**Truth:** PreloadQuery runs on the server during render. Dynamic rendering means it runs at request time instead of build time.

### ❌ Myth 2: "Dynamic rendering is always slower"

**Truth:** Initial load is fast because HTML includes data. Only slower than CDN-cached static pages, but we don't have a CDN setup.

### ❌ Myth 3: "I should use client-side fetching instead"

**Truth:** Client-side fetching is slower (extra round trip) and less SEO friendly. Our approach is optimal.

## ✅ Verification

### How to Verify It's Working

1. **Build Success:**

   ```bash
   yarn workspace @untitled/web build
   # Should complete without errors
   ```

2. **Check Route Type:**

   ```
   Build output shows:
   ƒ /diary  # ƒ = Dynamic rendering ✅
   ```

3. **Test in Browser:**
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/diary
   - View page source (Ctrl+U)
   - Search for diary titles
   - ✅ If you see actual data in HTML = PreloadQuery working!

4. **Network Tab:**
   - Open DevTools Network tab
   - Refresh page
   - ❌ Should NOT see GraphQL request from browser
   - ✅ Data already in HTML!

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Question:** Will PreloadQuery still work with `force-dynamic`?

**Answer:** **YES! They work perfectly together.**

- `force-dynamic` = **WHEN** to render (request time)
- `PreloadQuery` = **HOW** to fetch data (server-side)

**Our Architecture:**

```
User Request
  → Server renders page (force-dynamic)
  → PreloadQuery fetches data (server-side)
  → HTML sent with data
  → Browser displays instantly
```

**Result:**
✅ Fast initial loads  
✅ Always fresh data  
✅ No loading spinners  
✅ SEO friendly  
✅ Simple to maintain
